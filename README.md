# 100 Days of TypeScript Code

Welcome to the **100 Days of TypeScript Code** project! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of learning and mastering TypeScript over the course of 100 days. Each day, I will be tackling different TypeScript concepts, building mini-projects, and solving coding challenges.

## Introduction

TypeScript is a powerful, statically typed superset of JavaScript that enables developers to catch errors early through type checking and to write more maintainable code. This project aims to:

- Develop a deep understanding of TypeScript's features and best practices.
- Build a portfolio of TypeScript projects and code snippets.
- Document the learning process to help others who are also interested in learning TypeScript.
